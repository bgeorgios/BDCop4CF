Advances in Water Resources, p.104858. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2024.104858](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2024.104858)

## Summary
Assessing evolving relationships between flood drivers is crucial for bivariate flood hazard quantification. We have developed a Bayesian framework to model non-stationarity of compound flood hazard based on copulas whose parameter varies based on large-scale climate teleconnections.

## Details
Inside the ***"code"*** folder you will find two Stan programs that implement a dynamic Frank and Gumbel copula, respectively. In addition, in the same folder, you will find R scripts to run the analysis for the these dynamic copulas. Data from two estuaries are provided inside the ***"data"*** folder; these can be used to test the codes.
